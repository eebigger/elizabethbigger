She Programs the Code is a vision of a woman in daily modern life, breastfeeding her child while writing code. The child evokes the natural non-digital world, lying in a sheepskin on the motherâ€™s lap, illuminated within the space. The mother reaches up with one hand to write code onto a sheer terminal screen in front of her while her other hand and arm are fully embracing the child. The screen is illuminated with her code writing. A houseplant in the background has an illuminated low power notification within the trunk.  The digital world surrounds them through regular and future objects and the coding the mother is doing, while natural fibers and mother-child relationship remain strong natural elements within the narrative.

The woman, mother and programmer sits between the contrasting elements of the natural and digital worlds, balancing the power she has in programming futures.
