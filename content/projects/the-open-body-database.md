The Open Body Database was recently exhibited at Ars Electronica 2018. 

The Open Body Database is an open-source platform for collecting human body data. The main objective of this database is to support a fashion industry that is sustainable and is based on real human bodies. This initiates a discussion of physical human data collection, privacy and how bodies can be shared to aid in further discoveries, industry change or study.

<!--
# The Problems

- Garment design is not based on real human bodies
- No human body data repository exists for designers and researchers looking to work with real human body forms
- Sharing body data is complex due to issues of privacy

The garment industry utilizes unproportional design sketches and standard pattern grading and sizing to continue the mass production value chain. Access to body database(s) can be expensive and restricted, and therefore not user friendly to designers, researchers or students wishing to access real human body data and shapes.

# The Solution

The Open Body Database will:

- Create and Open Body Database where anyone can access real human body data
- Create guides for anyone to contribute real body data
- Create an automated data anonymization system

If proper tools and real body shapes are provided, the cycle of mass produced garment production can be altered creating an era of customization, design based on reality and healthier fashion and body outlooks. Designers, researchers, and students can access real human bodies and data, truly extending fashion and research utilizing the rich diversity of body realities.

Anyone can donate their body to the Open Body Database by submitting a 3d scan of themselves after filling out the transparent consent form. Scanning can be done in a variety of ways. Most of the first 100 entries into the Open Body Database are scanned with the original Kinect hardware and Scanect software. Each scan is then anonymized to protect the identity of the donor.

The project is currently a work in progress while the data pipeline and database schema are being developed.

The Open Body Database project was supported by the [Mozilla Open Leaders Program](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/round-6/projects/projects---cohort-c/).
