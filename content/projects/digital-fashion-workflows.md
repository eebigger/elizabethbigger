Fashion and garment design workflows vary greatly, some starting the design process with a “kernel” idea (Omwami 2020) and some an image database (Kato et al. 2018). Many researchers have discussed the workflow process of fashion and garment design, few have discussed the transition to using computational tools for circular design. Fig 1, shows a selection of relevant design and fashion design workflows: functional clothing, GANs, 3D CAD, and generative processes.  Find all the sources of the design workflows within the diagrams in the [references below.]({{< ref "#references" >}} )

Fig. 1a shows the traditional fashion design process of conceptual idea, sketch, pattern, toile, and sample developed by Timo Rissanen in 2007 (in McQuillan 2020). Fig.1b shows the traditional design process used in functional apparel design in 1981 from Koberg & Bagnall, (in Watkins & Dunne 2015). Fig. 1c shows two versions of the transition from Rissanen’s 2D workflow to a 3D CAD workflow for the zero-waste fashion method featuring the hybridization of the multiple iterative steps of 2D sketching, 3D draping, 2D pattern cutting, and 3D toileting, into a single 2D/3D design process (McMillian 2020). Fig. 1d shows the 3D fashion design process for Puma SE (Nina, V.T.K.N. 2019) Fig.1e is the design workflow for GANs fashion design discussing machine versus human roles. Fig. 1f is a basic
generative workflow (Tang & Cui 2017). Fig. 1g is the workflow for the creation of sports bras using generative design (Bosquet et al. 2020). Fig. 1h shows the The concept generator from Knapp 1988 (in Watkins & Dunne 2015) for an integrated protective clothing and equipment ensemble for the Canadian soldier which was projected for the year 2005. Knapp’s Concept Generator can be seen as the beginning in generative garment design comparable to Cedric Price’s Generator (Sopeoglou 2019) seen as one of the beginnings of generative design in architecture.

Figure 2 shows the generative fashion workflows for use of computational tools incorporating circularity goals. The four proposed workflows are similar in nature with the initial stages differing depending on the start point of the design process. If the process includes a 2D/3D design or a 3D virtual draping process, then the design is mathematically translated into a parametric fashion pattern or derived from a parametric pattern block/sloper. Parametric patterns and parametric pattern block/slopers are a draft of a pattern's curves represented by functions and variables. Circularity goals are then applied through circular design analytics used to create transformative algorithms. The workflow progresses to an evaluation of the optimization and towards either the selection from the algorithm (natural selection) or selection by the designer (artificial selection). If the optimized design is satisfactory, the process moves on to virtual fitting and tech pack13 creation, and finally to sample. In considering the previous workflows from fig. 1 it was important to keep an iterative process allowing for the continuous refinement of a design, as designers don’t follow a linear process, that design is necessarily messy and iterative (Davis 2020). The inclusion of the discussion of machines, humans, and designers was also important as advanced garment tools continue to be integrated in workflows. Many 3D workflows include the body scan processing as a design step, however automated processing of a body scan will become available for regular use and therefore unnecessary as part of future design workflow.
