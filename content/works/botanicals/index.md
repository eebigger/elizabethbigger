# ai botanical sketches & climate change haiku poems 

The AI botanical series speculates future species of epochs evolving from the human eras, cataloged to learn from what grew beyond the extinctions. Each species' artwork contains a haiku which identifies the domain within the evolving sprouting seasons. Use the QR code to find the unique haiku pinned to the IPFS. The works are to bring focus to the evolutionary cycles of nature and growth, and the human alterations from climate change integrated into these processes which evolve into new species. December 2022.

Inspired by: 
The haiku & watercolors depicting the story of climate change from the reports released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) created by climatologist and oceanographer, Greg Johnson (2013).

Abstract
This paper outlines how global warming has changed haiku season words by analyzing the effects of climate, geography and geology on the writing of haiku poetry.The specific problem under study is to measure the effects of global warming on the topics that haiku poets write about.The changes are significant enough that UNESCO could consider safeguarding haiku as an intangible world cultural heritage.

“Specifically, unlike either the Anthropocene or the Capitalocene, the Chthulucene is made up of ongoing multispecies stories and practices of becoming-with in times that remain at stake, in precarious times, in which the world is not finished and the sky has not fallen — yet. We are at stake to each other.” --Donna Haraway
