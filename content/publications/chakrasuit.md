# abstract

ChakraSuit is an experimental wearable which aids in finding the best location for meditation, enabling one to learn about the interaction between the natural environment, sound, and the body. The prototype continuously listens to ambient sounds, and translates the identified audio frequencies to vibration on several points along the spine which correspond to chakra points. The project consists of a jumpsuit, pocket, and harness with integrated electronics running on a Raspberry Pi W Zero.
