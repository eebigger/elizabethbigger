# Abstract

The provocation of black garments and textiles becoming illegal considers active measures for environmental impact through effluent and aquatic hypoxia prevention. Previous bans on toxic dye chemicals used in the garment industry have had challenges in enforcement. Intelligent consumer behavior, environmental responsibility and identity are considerable factors in banning the color black from garments parallel to its strong cultural importance. Traditional mechanisms of further research and policy changes for synthetic dyes and effluents have reduced effects, therefore non-traditional approaches may provide rapid climate impact.
