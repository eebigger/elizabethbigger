Lüme is an electronically infused clothing collection which integrates dynamic, user customizable elements driven wirelessly from a common mobile phone.  The design and engineering of the collection is focused on the integration of electronics in such a way that they could be easily removed or embedded when desired, thus creating pieces that are easy to wash and care for.  The initial objective for the collection was to create a series of garments that could adapt to the users daily life, changing in color depending on the event, location, mood, or even just to match another garment or accessory. The garments also can respond to sound, if the user pleases to select this option within the phone application.  The laser cut piece within each garment can also be customized, to another pattern (other than damask pattern), such as polka dots, flowers, lines, etc.  The entire mini collection when the electronics are not utilized, are simple black everyday garments, giving the wearer multi-use garments, for multiple looks.  A true blend of fashion and technology.

The Lüme collection won the Jury Prize in the Aesthetic Category at the [17th International Symposium of Wearable Computers (ISWC) in 2013](http://www.iswc.net/iswc14/calls/design.html).

The Lüme collection is made of three garments and one clutch all utilizing the same electronics system and mobile application. The main focus has been to integrate controllable lights to the garments. To date, the garments include a bomber jacket with a controllable Jackie collar, a tunic with a controllable neckline, and a bias-cut dress with a controllable back loop. All of the pieces implement several tailoring techniques allowing for the diffusion of the light and the channeling of the electronic components in such a way that they can be easily embedded and removed. The light diffusion system on the garments consists of a series of fabric layers complemented with a laser cut fabric piece. Diffusing the LED light gives a softer feel to the electronics within the garments and further accentuates the concept of blending electronics and textile into a cohesive piece. The laser cut piece can also be customized to another pattern, such as polka dots, etc. The lights are hosted in specific fabric channels and the electronics sit in interior pockets. This allows the electronics to not come into contact with the wearer ́s skin. The clutch utilizes special light diffusing acrylic panel to enhance the aesthetics of a typical large clutch. Again, the user can control the light pattern to match other elements in their outfit, react to a sensor event, or even echo the colors in the surrounding environment.
