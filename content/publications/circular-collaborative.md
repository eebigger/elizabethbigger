# abstract

The circular collaborative customization business model combines user-centric design, advanced garment technologies and circularity within a microfactory typology to solve prevailing issues with the environmental and socioeconomic impact of the mass production model by the garment industry. Solution models that rely on mass production will quickly become antiqued as circularity and customization continues to gain awareness. The multi-method approach allows for economic and climate goals to be addressed in parallel with consumer demands for the future of fashion.
