Elizabeth Bigger is an artist based in Barcelona, Spain, exploring ecologies currently through new media—javascript, threejs, artificial intelligence, 3d scanning and visual programming—questioning the interplay between the authenticity of being and belonging within environments. She often writes & researches in depth to accompany her artworks as she enjoys the discovery processes during creation. Elizabeth is currently in a sabbatical learning to incorporate physics into her coding practice, while developing *Verb Parameters.* 

She has been exploring generative and wearable systems, parametrization and bespoke digital garment systems for the previous decade balanced with studying ethics, data privacy and the integration of climate change impact within these systems for Industry 5.0. She has been motivated by the engineering and functional garment aspects of design, data driven design and the psychological aspects of virtual bodies.

Elizabeth has lectured and exhibited globally at Copernicus Science Centre in Warsaw, Poland; Milan Design Week in Milan, Italy; Ars Electronica in Linz, Austria; Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich (ETH Zurich) in Zurich, Switzerland; Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Baden-Württemberg, Germany; University of Minnesota, St.Paul Campus, Minnesota, United States; The Global System for Mobile Communications Association Mobile World Congress, Barcelona, Spain; Queen Elizabeth II Centre, London, United Kingdom; Carrousel du Louvre Exhibition Hall, Paris, France; Fiera di Roma, Rome, Italy, La Scuola Universitaria Professionale della Svizzera, Lugano, Switzerland and Koh Lon Island in Rawai, Thailand.
