Elizabeth Bigger is a computational garment practitioner and the founder of GenCloth, exploring parametric and generative garment design. Elizabeth is interested in creating bespoke garment systems for the integration of data and waste reduction. She began as a traditional tailor crafting bespoke garments for fifteen years in the United States. When she immigrated to Barcelona, Spain on a spousal visa, she did not have the right to work for over a decade. During this time Elizabeth focused on research to included computational programming, parametric design, and electronic hardware into her garment practice. She brings a unique perspective as a tailor to computational design workflows. 

Elizabeth is currently in a sabbatical year training for her 4rd marathon, learning to further physics into her scripting practice and compiling the last decade of her scripts & works.

She has lectured and exhibited globally at Copernicus Science Centre in Warsaw, Poland; Milan Design Week in Milan, Italy; Ars Electronica in Linz, Austria; Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich (ETH Zurich) in Zurich, Switzerland; Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Baden-Württemberg, Germany; University of Minnesota, St.Paul Campus, Minnesota, United States; The Global System for Mobile Communications Association Mobile World Congress, Barcelona, Spain; Queen Elizabeth II Centre, London, United Kingdom; Carrousel du Louvre Exhibition Hall, Paris, France; Fiera di Roma, Rome, Italy, La Scuola Universitaria Professionale della Svizzera, Lugano, Switzerland and Koh Lon Island in Rawai, Thailand. Elizabeth has exhibited locally at institutions such as Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya and the Disseny Hub Barcelona in Barcelona, Spain.

Elizabeth has been awarded three international design awards from the International Symposium of Wearable Computing in fiber arts and aesthetics. Elizabeth has also been awarded a grant from WEAR Sustain, a European Union Horizon 2020 fund and an artist grant from the Mobile World Capital Digital Futures Barcelona Edition.
