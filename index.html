      <h1>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</h1>
      <p>
        A free bird leaps<br>
        on the back of the wind<br>
        and floats downstream<br>
        till the current ends<br>
        and dips his wing<br>
        in the orange sun rays<br>
        and dares to claim the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        But a bird that stalks<br>
        down his narrow cage<br>
        can seldom see through<br>
        his bars of rage<br>
        his wings are clipped and<br>
        his feet are tied<br>
        so he opens his throat to sing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The caged bird sings<br>
        with a fearful trill<br>
        of things unknown<br>
        but longed for still<br>
        and his tune is heard<br>
        on the distant hill<br>
        for the caged bird<br>
        sings of freedom.
